# RNG Weapon Perk Project
 An in progress project based around recreating the random weapon perk system from Destiny 2.

 This project aims at creating a scalable weapon perk system. The plan is to create structs for the weapon perks and stats, these will then be stored on a weapon.
 When the weapon is picked up and the inventory screen is opened, it will display the stats and perks that the weapon has. This project is designed to be scalable, so that the weapons can hold as many stats and weapon perk columns as are needed by the dev.
 These should be able to be added in as easy a way as possible, which is why TArrays were used (the Unreal Engine equivalent of vectors).
